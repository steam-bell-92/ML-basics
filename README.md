# Linear Regression on Iris Dataset

This project demonstrates the implementation of **Linear Regression** using the **Iris dataset**. Although the dataset is typically used for classification, here we adapt it for regression to predict versicolor features such as petal width and petal length.

- Even though it can be done without using gradient descent by closed-form solution but it would be constrained.
- Also I took it as a thing to do with `gradient descent` only.

## 🧠 BSoC Attribution

This project was completed during **Week 1 (June 16–22, 2025)** of the **Summer of Machine Learning (SoML)** track under **BSoC**.

## 🚀 Enhancements

- 📊 Hosted on **GitHub Pages** for interactive visualizations  
- 📁 Plotted **Plotly Express** Plots along with Seaborn.

## 📌 Objective

1. To explore relationships between different features in the Iris dataset and build a linear regression model to predict one feature from another using `gradient descent`.
2. To share EDA report results via a web page.

## 📊 Dataset

The project uses the [Iris dataset](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.datasets.load_iris.html#sklearn.datasets.load_iris) from `scikit-learn`. It includes:
- Sepal length
- Sepal width
- Petal length
- Petal width

Only the **Versicolor** subset is used for training and evaluation.
