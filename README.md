# Linear Regression on Iris Dataset

This project demonstrates the implementation of **Linear Regression** using the **Iris dataset**. Although the dataset is typically used for classification, here we adapt it for regression to predict flower features such as petal or sepal dimensions.

## 📌 Objective

1. To explore relationships between different features in the Iris dataset and build a linear regression model to predict one feature from another using both manual and `scikit-learn` approaches.
2. To shared results via a web page for end-users.

## 📊 Dataset

The project uses the [Iris dataset](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/auto_examples/datasets/plot_iris_dataset.html) from `scikit-learn`. It includes:
- Sepal length
- Sepal width
- Petal length
- Petal width

Only the **Versicolor** subset is used for training and evaluation.

## 📈 EDA Report

An automated exploratory data analysis (EDA) report is included in HTML format (`Report_flower.html`). It contains:
- Summary statistics
- Feature distributions
- Correlation heatmaps
- Outlier analysis
Open it in your browser to explore the dataset insights before modeling.
